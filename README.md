# Observations
- Within the last year of the data, there appears to be a periodicity to the amount of precipitation, where the most rainfall happens towards the end of each month.
- The most active station was found to be USC00519281 which is Waihee, HI on the island of Maui with a min, max and average temperature of 54.0, 85.0, and 71.7, respectively.
- The mode temperature of the above station is around 76 degrees.
- From the July 2017 data, it looks like the average temperature would be around 78 degrees ... a wonderful time for us to spend our anniversary!
